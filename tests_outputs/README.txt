A representative subset of tests is made available to the students to verify their implementation. 
These tests do not cover the extensions proposed in the project assignment! They are intended to
verify the basic functionalities of the Project.

Two types of tests were included:
	I. Tests whose result is unique.
	II. Tests whose goal is to make you think about specific aspects of your implementation. 

Note that, whenever the project assignment does not specify the expected behavior, you should 
make a founded decision that makes sense in the context of what is being asked, e.g., 
either because CLOS' behavior is similar, or because Julia's behavior is identical, etc. 
Either way, these are just a few examples of questions that your teacher might pose during the
presentation and you should prepare yourself. 

Tests: E, F, J and O are tests of type-II.
All other are tests of type-I.
